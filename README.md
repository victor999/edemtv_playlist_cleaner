Edem TV Playlist cleaner

I was not satisfied with playlist that can be downloaded. Many duplicated channels.

This Python script cleans the playlist and produces a new playlist, removing FHD, orig, and +1, +2, etc. channels

Using:

Put playlist.m3u8 at the same folder as a script

Run script

Resulted playlist will be in the same folder
